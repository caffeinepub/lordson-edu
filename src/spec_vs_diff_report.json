  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 11 requirements from the BuildRequest. Backend includes complete CRUD operations for students, courses, and enrollments with proper data structures. Frontend includes all required management interfaces with list views, detail views, forms, and enrollment functionality. A cohesive, professional design theme is implemented using warm colors (blue primary, orange accents) with consistent typography and layout patterns. Internet Identity authentication is properly integrated. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not mention user profiles, profile setup dialogs, or profile management features. These appear in backend/main.mo and frontend components (ProfileSetupDialog.tsx, Layout.tsx showing userProfile.name)",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly defers 'Role-based dashboards for administrators, directors, professors' to future iterations and lists it as a non-goal. However, the backend implements AccessControl with admin-only restrictions on create/update/delete operations and user permissions for read operations",

      "reason": "REQ-10 mentions enrollment from 'student detail view or course detail view', but the BuildRequest does not explicitly require a course detail view showing enrolled students. The implementation adds CourseDetailPage.tsx with full student enrollment display",
